# Neural Network

## Description (main.py)
- This code does not use sklearn functions (from scratch)
- This code implements a simple neural network (NN) to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 - 9) from the MNIST dataset.
- This NN has a single hidden layer (sigmoid function as activation) and cross entropy loss (softmax function for the output layer).

## Execution
```
python main.py
```

## Description (vTensorFlow.py)
- This version of code uses TensorFlow functions to valid the previous results.

## Execution
