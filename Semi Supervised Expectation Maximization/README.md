# Semi Supervised Expectation Maximization

## Description (main.py)
- This code does not use sklearn functions (from scratch)
- This code implements Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to apply semi-supervised EM algorithm with labelled and unlabelled data.
- E-step and M-step are computed.
- The input data (or new data) is clustered.

## Execution
```
python main.py
```

## Description (vscikit-learn.py)
- This version of code uses sklearn functions to valid the previous results (Unsupervised Expectation-Maximization).

## Execution
```
python vscikit-learn.py
```
